      "message": "My understanding is that the tests do not do that much with the template, and they do pass with any value put there. Essentially, just eliminating use of the get_secret function seems enough.\n\nThe values look intentionally invalid, so that if they do become an issue, it can be discovered quickly from where they got sourced.\n\nIn case you know of a reviewer who might have an opinion what different values are needed, please engage him with the ticket/review.",
