      "message": "The log record being written as \"msg\" to the log file is incomplete.  The ctx.logger.* methods provide important additional information when they write a record--like the node instance, the operation that\u0027s being performed, etc.   The log file is also incomplete because it does not contain the records dropped by the Cloudify process that\u0027s calling into the plugin.  In short, the log file that\u0027s being written here is of extremely limited value.",
